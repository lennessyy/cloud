= Workspace Settings
:experimental:

The settings in workspace allow users to customize and fine-tune various aspects of their workspace configuration.
These settings include options like *auto-suspend* and *auto-resume*, which automate the suspension and resumption of the workspace based on activity levels.

Find them by clicking on the btn:[ ... ] button on your workspace next to the btn:[Connect] button.

=== Auto-Suspend

Auto-suspend will automatically suspend your workspace after a specified period of inactivity.

[TIP]
====
This helps optimize resource utilization and cost when the workspace is not actively being used.
====

Choose an appropriate time interval for auto-suspend based on your typical usage patterns.

For example, if your workspace is usually inactive for long periods, you can set a shorter interval for auto-suspend to conserve resources.

[CAUTION]
Be mindful of any background processes or scheduled tasks that may require the workspace to remain active.
Adjust the auto-suspend interval accordingly to avoid interrupting critical processes.

==== Auto-Suspend Limitations

.The following operations are not treated as "active" and will not prevent the workspace from being auto-suspended:
* Configuring the workspace.
* Monitoring the workspace.
* Backuping/Restoring the workspace.

=== Auto-Resume
Auto-resume will automatically resume your workspace when activity is detected.

[TIP]
====
This ensures a seamless user experience without the need for manual intervention.
====

When the Auto Resume is enabled, the workspace will become “Idle” state instead of “Stopped”.
Auto-resume will kick-in when users access tools and rest APIs.

==== Auto-Resume Limitations

.The following endpoints will not trigger auto-resume:
* TigerGraph Cloud Controller APIs

== Add-ons

== Alerts

== Graph Admin
