= Workspace Size

When creating a workspace, you can specify the size based on your data and performance requirements.
TigerGraph Cloud 4 offers multiple size options, allowing you to choose the appropriate capacity for your graph databases.

[TIP]
The size determines the number of instances and the allocated resources for your workspace.
