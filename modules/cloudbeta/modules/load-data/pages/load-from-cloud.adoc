= Load from the Cloud

If you store your data in AWS S3, TigerGraph Cloud provides seamless integration for data ingestion. You can directly load data from your S3 buckets into your graph databases, eliminating the need for manual data transfers. This simplifies the process of importing large datasets and enables you to leverage the scalability and durability of AWS S3 for your graph analysis.

Select source
Once you’ve selected AWS S3, you will be asked to configure the AWS S3 data source.

Click on  to add a new AWS S3 data source.

You will need to provide your S3 access key ID and S3 secret access key. Once you have the access key id and the secret access key configured, you can add one or multiple S3 URIs within the same S3 bucket.

Click Next to process the file(s).

Note:
The current Data Ingestion tool only supports CSV files. We are actively working on adding support for other file formats, and this functionality will be available soon. Stay tuned for updates!

Configure File
This step lets you configure the source file details.

The data ingestion tool will automatically detect the csv separators and line breaks.The parser automatically splits each line into a series of tokens. If the parsing is not correct, click on button to configure a different option for the delimiter, eol, quote and header.




The enclosing character is used to mark the boundaries of a token, overriding the delimiter character. For example, if your delimiter is a comma, but you have commas in

some strings, then you can define single or double quotes as the enclosing character to mark the endpoints of your string tokens.

It is not necessary for every token to have enclosing characters. The parser uses enclosing characters when it encounters them.

You can edit the header line of the parsing result to give each column a more intuitive name, since you will be referring to these names when loading data to the graph. The header name is ignored during data loading.

Once you are satisfied with the file settings, click Next to proceed.

Configure Map
If you are loading data into a brand new graph, you will be prompted to let our engine generate a schema and mapping for you. You can select only generate the schema or generate both the schema and the data mapping.

Note:
The schema generation feature in TigerGraph Cloud is designed to expedite the data loading process. However, we want to emphasize that we do not provide a guarantee for the correctness and efficiency of the resulting graph schema and mapping.


Or you can start from scratch. For more details of schema design please refer to Schema Designer.

You can configure the attributes and mappings here.

Click Next to proceed.

Confirm
The step will let you confirm the changes made to the schema and the data mapping you created to load the data.

Note:
Please be aware that some schema changes will result in unintentional deletion of the data. Please carefully review the warning message before confirming the loading.
