= Load from local File

With TigerGraph Cloud, you can easily load data from local files into your graph databases. Whether you have data in CSV, JSON, or other formats, you can use the intuitive data ingestion process to import your data. Simply upload your files, specify the schema mapping, and let TigerGraph Cloud handle the rest. This allows you to quickly populate your graph databases with the necessary data for analysis.

== Select source

Once you’ve selected Local File, you can click on to upload your files or directly drag and drop your files in the File Details window.

Click Next to process the file
Note:
The current Data Ingestion tool only supports CSV files. We are actively working on adding support for other file formats, and this functionality will be available soon. Stay tuned for updates!

== Configure File
This step lets you configure the source file details.

The data ingestion tool will automatically detect the csv separators and line breaks.The parser automatically splits each line into a series of tokens. If the parsing is not correct, click on button to configure a different option for the delimiter, eol, quote and header.

The enclosing character is used to mark the boundaries of a token, overriding the delimiter character. For example, if your delimiter is a comma, but you have commas in some strings, then you can define single or double quotes as the enclosing character to mark the endpoints of your string tokens.

It is not necessary for every token to have enclosing characters. The parser uses enclosing characters when it encounters them.

You can edit the header line of the parsing result to give each column a more intuitive name, since you will be referring to these names when loading data to the graph. The header name is ignored during data loading.

Once you are satisfied with the file settings, click Next to proceed.

== Configure Map
If you are loading data into a brand new graph, you will be prompted to let our engine generate a schema and mapping for you. You can select only generate the schema or generate both the schema and the data mapping.

Note:
The schema generation feature in TigerGraph Cloud is designed to expedite the data loading process. However, we want to emphasize that we do not provide a guarantee for the correctness and efficiency of the resulting graph schema and mapping.


Or you can start from scratch. For more details of schema design please refer to Schema Designer.

ou can configure the attributes and mappings here.

Confgure mappings:

In the "Source" column, you can choose the specific column from the data source that you want to map with the attribute.

Use the “+” button to create a new attribute of the target vertex or edge.


Auto Mapping:

The "Map all to target" button aligns existing attribute names with the corresponding data source headers to establish mappings.
The "Map all from source" button not only aligns existing attributes but also introduces new attributes based on unmatched data source headers.

Click Next to proceed.

== Confirm
The step will let you confirm the changes made to the schema and the data mapping you created to load the data.

Note:
Please be aware that some schema changes will result in unintentional deletion of the data. Please carefully review the warning message before confirming the loading.
