= Comparison with Other TigerGraph Offerings

== Wth TigerGraph Cloud

== With TigerGraph Enterprise Server

Most of the documentation for TigerGraph Enterprise Server also applies to TigerGraph Cloud.
However, since TigerGraph Cloud does not have a command-line interface on the OS level, command-line features are not supported in the same way.
In many cases, there is a GUI-based method for the same feature.
For advanced OS-level commands, submit a support ticket for more information.
