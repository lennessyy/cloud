= Expansion and Shrink

As your data grows or changes, you may need to adjust the capacity of your workspaces.
Users can easily expand or shrink workspaces to accommodate the evolving needs of graph databases.

You can scale up or down as required, ensuring optimal performance and cost-effectiveness.

[NOTE]
====
Before initiating a downsize operation, a data topology size check is performed to ensure that the workspace size can accommodate the data.
If the size check fails, the downsize operation will not be allowed.

You can select a size in the drop menu

Note:
Please be aware that resizing of workspaces is only allowed for Read-Write (RW) workspaces. Resizing of Read-Only (RO) workspaces is strictly forbidden and not supported. You can recreate a RO workspace if you need to resize it.

Resizing typically will take about 2 mins depending on the data size and the workspace size.

Note:
Please note that expansion/shrink is an offline operation.

If there are any other operations in progress on the workspace, they will be affected.

It is recommended to schedule the expansion/shrink during a time when minimal or no operations are expected on the workspace to avoid any potential disruptions.
