= Advanced Workspace Settings
:experimental:

The advanced settings in workspace allow users to customize and fine-tune various aspects of their workspace configuration.
These settings include options like *auto-suspend* and *auto-resume*, which automate the suspension and resumption of the workspace based on activity levels.

Find them by clicking on the btn:[ ... ] button on your workspace next to the btn:[Connect] button.

Users can choose the desired time intervals for auto-suspend and enable auto-resume to optimize resource usage and ensure a smooth user experience.

== Auto-Suspend

Auto-suspend will automatically suspend your workspace after a specified period of inactivity.

[TIP]
====
This helps optimize resource utilization and cost when the workspace is not actively being used.
====

Choose an appropriate time interval for auto-suspend based on your typical usage patterns.

For example, if your workspace is usually inactive for long periods, you can set a shorter interval for auto-suspend to conserve resources.

[CAUTION]
Be mindful of any background processes or scheduled tasks that may require the workspace to remain active.
Adjust the auto-suspend interval accordingly to avoid interrupting critical processes.

=== Auto-Suspend Limitations

.The following operations will not trigger an auto suspend:
* Any UI tools access.
* Running any GSQL query.
* Running loading job.

[TIP]
====
This ensures a seamless user experience without the need for manual intervention.
