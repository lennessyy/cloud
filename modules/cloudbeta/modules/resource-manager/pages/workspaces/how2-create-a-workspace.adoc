For more details, please refer to xref:cloudBeta:resource-manager:workspaces/writeread_readonly.adoc[].
+
. Specify Add-ons to your workspace, for more details please visit xref:cloudBeta:integrations:add-ons.adoc[] page.

. Click on the btn:[ Create ] button to create the workspace.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, only one Read-Write workspace can be created for any given database.
This means that multiple simultaneous Read-Write workspaces cannot be created, potentially limiting certain collaborative or concurrent development scenarios.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Users cannot re-create the Read-Write workspace once it has been terminated.

== Next Steps

Now, that you have a workspace created see xref:cloudBeta:resource-manager:workspaces/advanced-settings/advanced-settings.adoc[] or learn more about xref:cloudBeta:resource-manager:workspaces/writeread_readonly.adoc[].
