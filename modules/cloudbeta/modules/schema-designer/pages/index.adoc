= Get Started with Schema Designer
:experimental:

The Schema Designer provides a user-friendly interface for schema management, allowing you to adapt your graph database to changing requirements and optimize its performance.

[TIP]
====
The graph schema defines the structure of your graph database, influencing its performance and functionality.
====

With the Schema Designer, you can easily modify and manage the schema of your graph databases by:

* Defining vertex and edge types.
* Specifying properties and indexes.
* Establish relationships between elements.

== 1) Get Started

.Navigate to the Schema Designer. It is accessible from:
* A Workspace page
* GSQL Editor page
* Load Data pages
* Solution Builder page

== 2) Create a Graph

Before creating vertices and edges, you need to create a graph in the Schema Designer.

[TIP]
====
A graph represents the overall structure and framework of your graph database.
====

.When creating a graph, you define:
* Its name.
* Any global settings or configurations that apply to the entire graph.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can skip creating a graph if you are defining the global graph schema.
====

. Now click on the btn:[Create New Graph] button in the graph selector dropdown menu.

. Specify the graph name in the pop-up window.

[NOTE]
====
The initial creation of the first graph may require up to 2 minutes as the services warm up and the necessary environment is set up.
====

== 3) Create a Vertex

.You can now create vertices to define the entities or nodes in your graph database. Vertices represent distinct entities you want to represent in your graph model, such as:
* users
* products
* locations
* or any other objects .

Creating vertices involves specifying the vertex name and any attributes associated with it.

. Click on the image:Screenshot 2024-04-17 at 7.39.38 PM.png[width=100] button, or hold key btn:[ V]  and btn:[ Left Click ] on the graph to create a vertex.


. Once a vertex is created, you can configure the name and its attributes in the properties panel.

== 4) Create a Edge

Create edges to establish relationships between vertices in your graph database.

[TIP]
====
Edges represent the connections or relationships between entities.
====

When creating an edge, you define the edge name, the source vertex, the target vertex, and any attributes associated with the edge.

. Use your mouse drag from the border of a vertex and drop to a new position to create a new vertex and new edge or drop to an existing vertex to only create a new edge.

. Once an edge is created, you can now configure the edge name, and its attributes in the properties panel.

== 5) Attributes

Attributes play a crucial role in defining the properties or characteristics of vertices and edges in your graph database.
You can define attributes for vertices and edges to store additional information about them.

[TIP]
====
Attributes can be of different data types, such as strings, integers, booleans, or dates, and they provide valuable context and details to your graph data.
